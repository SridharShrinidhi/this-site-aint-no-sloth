        <p class="kilo island-half push-none">Sloths are mammals classified in the families <em>Megalonychidae</em> (two-toed sloths) and <em>Bradypodidae</em> (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy
          at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy.</p>
        <p class="kilo island-half push-half">Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs.</p>

        <p class="kilo push-none island-half push-none">They are classified in the order Pilosa because they are related to anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Extinct sloth species include many megafaunal ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants, as well as
          a few species of marine sloths. Extant sloths are medium-sized arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America.</p>
        <p class="kilo island-half push-half">Sloths make good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.</p>
